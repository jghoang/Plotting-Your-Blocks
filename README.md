# Plotting-Your-Blocks

Try to duplicate the image below by adjusting the CSS code provided. Use margins and paddings to adjust the spaces between divisions and use the display property to be able to put each block in its proper place. You may need additional CSS properties. While you do this assignment, please use min-height as well as vertical align to give minimum height to the division and also to vertically align some of the inline-blocks.  Also, please do NOT use float (use display:inline-block instead).
